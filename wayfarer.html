              People who backpack have been surrounded by a variety of travel
              information whether it may be from books, online travel
              applications, to high-end custom travel agencies. However many
              have an experience that these resources are generic and lack
              authenticity which makes it difficult for backpackers to have a
              more customizable and adventurous experience.

            <h3 class="caseheader2"><b>user research.</b></h3>
            <p class="aboutme2">
              Originally during my <b>first round of interviews</b>, I realized
              I was too broad and only focused on the general idea of how they
              plan their trip. I decided to dive deeper and do another round of
              interviews specifically about backpacking.
              <b

              planned to dive deep into our research to identify and understand

            <p class="paragraph_spacing">
              The surveys captured great quantitative results with some trending

              I gathered my data and created an affinity diagram. There was alot

              picked out similiarities between each person. I separated the
              diagrams into 6 categories. Here's some key points I learned:
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • When they are planning they prefer to use resources that are
              more personal to guide them such as talking to other or reading
              travel blogs.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • Budgeting and figuring out the cost for travels when traveling solo
              or with a group. 
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">

            <h3 class="caseheader2"><b>so what's the problem then?</b></h3>
            <p class="aboutme2">
              I have observed that backpackers find it difficult
              to search the plans of their particular interests through the
              internet, specifically travel agencies, because it does not give
              many unique options and many are too generic and lack
              authenticity.
              <b
                >How can I provide an app that brings an immersive and
                customized destination for all backpackers that is shared

              three (closed) card sorting tests here are some of the key points
              we kept in mind before we started on the lo-fi.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • Move the store into the "Donation" category since all payments
              are considered as a <b>donation</b> to AAH.

            <h3 class="caseheader2"><b>sitemap.</b></h3>
            <p class="aboutme2">
              The card sorting helped us figure out how we wanted the whole
              navigation to look like. We created a site-map to get a better
              sense of how users will navigate from primary to secondary.
            </p>

            <h3 class="caseheader2"><b>lo-fi wireframes.</b></h3>
            <p class="aboutme2">
              We then went the phase of sketching our wireframes to get a
              general idea of how AAH was going to look. Before working on the
              visual and content design, I wanted to have the basic structure of
              the website. I kept in mind of accessibilty and how it would
              affect the user when browsing the programs, events, donating to
              the organization.

            </h3>
            <p class="aboutme2">
              Then we transferred our sketches into a digital lo-fi wireframe.
              After user testing, we received alot of feed. We wanted to make
              sure we wanted to emphasize:
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • The <b>"Donation"</b> button. Since the organization is
              <b>100% donation based</b>, we believe that making this cateogory
              stand out is most was important.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • The <b>"Mission Statement"</b>. It's important for the user to
              know what the organization is about, and we believe in their old
              website design, it was difficult for users to understand what
              their goal/mission was. We want to make sure in this new
              re-design, we utilize the white space, making text easier to
              breathe and read.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • The <b>"Calendar/Events Category"</b>. The navigation experience
              for the calendar cateogory from the old website was very outdated
              and confusing for the user because of the infiinite scroll making
              them feel lost. We wanted to use a card UI design layout to make
              it accessible to distinguish each event.

              I took the role in designing the whole UI style for the website.
              We decided to keep the main color of purple, but make it more
              vivid, along with other colors as well such as yellow and pink. We
              want the color palette to
              <b
                >express a sense of playfulness, happiness, and engagement. Some
                other changes we made that we believe will help represent AAH
                are:

            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Redesigning the logo:</b> The old logo was hard to visualize
              and the quality was low-res. We simplified the logo to make it
              feel very wholesome and happy.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Font change:</b> As much as we all love Comic Sans, it's very
              outdated. However, we decided to keep the "rounded style" and used
              <b>SF Pro Rounded</b> which expresses a more playful yet simple
              style.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Icon design:</b> Icons from the old website was very
              consistent and lacked in style. The new AAH icons are stylize with
              more expression and consistency.

              <b>Navigation:</b> The primary navigation is a simple dropdown for

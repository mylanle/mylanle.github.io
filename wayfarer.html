              People who backpack have been surrounded by a variety of travel
              information whether it may be from books, online travel
              applications, to high-end custom travel agencies. However many
              have an experience that these resources are generic and lack
              authenticity which makes it difficult for backpackers to have a
              more customizable and adventurous experience.

              Originally during my <b>first round of interviews</b>, I realized
              I was too broad and only focused on the general idea of how they
              plan their trip. I decided to dive deeper and do another round of
              interviews specifically about backpacking.
              <b

              • When they are planning they prefer to use resources that are

              I have observed that backpackers find it difficult to search the

              specifically travel agencies, because it does not give many unique
              options and many are too generic and lack authenticity.

              However, many travelers have experiences times where the travel plans hosted by WorldPacker

              • <b>Font change:</b> As much as we all love Comic Sans, it's very
              outdated. However, we decided to keep the "rounded style" and used
              <b>SF Pro Rounded</b> which expresses a more playful yet simple

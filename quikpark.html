              Parking can be difficult and time-consuming to find in the city.
              With very limited available parking spots, drivers feel stressed,
              frustrated, and possibly arrive late to their destination. They
              want to find available, cheap, and reliable spots quickly.

              We then went the phase of sketching my wireframes with a pencil

              Before working on the visual and content design, I wanted to have
              the basic structure of the app. I kept in mind of accessibilty and
              how it would affect the user when searching for parking spots
              inside their car.

              User Flow and wireframe sketches helped us visualize how our
              concept is going to look and if the flow made sense. From there,
              we created two digital wireframes A/B testing with different
              functions. We mainly wanted to figure out where to place the filter
              and search bar on the homepage for accessibilty reasons.

              We then tested both of the possibility with our clickable
              prototype and kept the one who worked best for users. From the
              first testing results Test A was the best option because it was easier to
              find the filter button, the bottom search bar was better for one
              handed use and it was also clearer and simpler to use.

              have an experience that these resources are generic and lack

              • When Michael finds what he is looking for (let's say a blog he found interesting), he can choose to read it by clicking the desired blog another backpacker posted.  
              Once there, the blog provides him with details about the backpacker's experience, how long that person traveled, and how much money was spent. This helps Michael 
              get an idea of what the trip will look like if he were to travel based off the backpackers blog.

              <b>Posting:</b> The main goal for this app was to search for meaningful and valuable expereinces through other people. However, I added an additional 
              feature where the user can also post their experience as well. Let's say Michael went on an amazing backpacking trip a month ago. He wants to share it through Wayfarer. 
              If he is on the homepage screen, he can locate the post feature on the bottom screen where the navigation is (the + icon in the middle)

              • Michael clicks the "Blog" button and can start typing his story. He will need to add the location of his trip so it will help other 
              backpackers know where the trip was located.

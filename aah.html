              <b>Animal Assisted Happiness</b> is an organization that focuses
              on bringing animal interactions to childrens and their family
              members. Specifically they want to enrich the lives of youths who
              have special needs and disabilities and providing them with an
              experience that brings positivity. Their vision is a "Million
              Smiles". The organization is 100% donation based and relies
              heavily on volunteer participation.
            </p>
            <h3 class="caseheader2"><b>the problem.</b></h3>
            <p class="aboutme2">
              Currently their website does not align with their mission, which
              is bringing joy and happiness for the youth through animals.

                >How might increase the visibility and trust with a more
                accessible website design therefore increasing donations and

            <h3 class="caseheader2"><b>user research.</b></h3>
            <p class="aboutme2">
              We surveyed <b>39 people</b> to get a scope of how people
              typically interact with non-profits and charities, and how they
              would interact with a non-profit that works with children and
              animals. We learned that not many people volunteer often and we
              believe this could be one of AAH goals for their website which is
              getting more volunteers since this organization does rely heavily
              on them. We also want to see what payment option users prefer, we
              think it’s really important since this organization is 100%
              donated base, we want to feel that the website and what payment
              provider they use it reliable and trustworthy.

              We also conducted 5 usability tests and have our users test out
              the website itself and we received a lot of feedback. Some of the
              comments that stood out to us that we could definitely keep in
              mind with the recreation of the website.

            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>The navigation i</b>s simple but it could use a secondary for

              easily and quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Icon styles</b> are inconsistent and misleading. “Shopping
              Bag” could be misunderstood as a “Check Out” or “View Shopping
              Cart”. Icon placements on top right can also be missed by the
              user.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Text</b> isn't readable. Users have complained about the
              purple text being too hard to read along with condensed/tight
              spacing between the lines. We would suggest changing the font and
              color.

              We wanted to prioritize the main navigation first. We conducted a

            <p class="bulletpoints">

              The card sorting helped us figure out how we wanted the whole

              sense of how users will navigate from primary to secondary.

              We then went the phase of sketching our wireframes to get a
              general idea of how AAH was going to look. Before working on the
              visual and content design, I wanted to have the basic structure of
              the website. I kept in mind of accessibilty and how it would
              affect the user when browsing the programs, events, donating to
              the organization.

              Then we transferred our sketches into a digital lo-fi wireframe.
              After user testing, we received alot of feed. We wanted to make sure 
              we wanted to emphasize:
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • The <b>"Donation"</b> button. Since the organization is
              <b>100% donation based</b>, we believe that making this cateogory
              stand out is most was important.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • The <b>"Mission Statement"</b>. It's important for the user to
              know what the organization is about, and we believe in their old
              website design, it was difficult for users to understand what
              their goal/mission was. We want to make sure in this new
              re-design, we utilize the white space, making text easier to
              breathe and read.
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • The <b>"Calendar/Events Category"</b>. The navigation experience
              for the calendar cateogory from the old website was very outdated
              and confusing for the user because of the infiinite scroll making
              them feel lost. We wanted to use a card UI design layout to make
              it accessible to distinguish each event.

              I took the role in designing the whole UI style for the website.
              We decided to keep the main color of purple, but make it more vivid, 
              along with other colors as well such as yellow and pink. We want the 
              color palette to <b>express a sense of playfulness, happiness, and

            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Redesigning the logo:</b> The old logo was hard to visualize and the quality was low-res.
              We simplified the logo to make it feel very wholesome and happy. 
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Font change:</b> As much as we all love Comic Sans, it's very outdated. However, we decided 
              to keep the "rounded style" and used <b>SF Pro Rounded</b> which expresses a more playful yet simple style. 
            </p>
            <p class="bulletpoints">
              • <b>Icon design:</b> Icons from the old website was very consistent and lacked in style. The new AAH icons 
              are stylize with more expression and consistency.
